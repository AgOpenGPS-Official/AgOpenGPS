v1.6 Jan 2017

* UDP server for GPS, section control etc
* TCP server just because.
* Contour guidance now, merged with lightbar and same nomenclature as ABLine
* Area Calculations
* Module communication class
* Assorted bugs fixed


v1.5 Dec 20 2016

* Camera can use heading of calculated by fix - settable in settings
* Automatic breakup of patches, every 100 triangles, so Frustum culling is more effective
* Auto NMEA frequency determination.
* tramlines settable frequency and start position. Multi coloured.
* Speed compensated lookahead. Based on work of Torriem.
* No longer use of timers, data comes in updates/sec so app must conform, not other way around.
* Completely reworked frame timing. "Fast" loop continuously runs and only once a complete NMEA 
	sentence appears then fix position and draw routine are fired. Based off of 20 Hz watchdog timer
* Each section has its own accumulated acres in its button
* FINALLY runs nicely at 10 hz update 



v1.3.1.1 Dec 1 2016

* TCP server added. Port 7777
* tileable textures for field surface
* WebCam support
* New and close job are now; resume - new - open; in its own dialog
* exiting asks if you want to save field if one is open
* custom timeout message dialog - non modal
* custom YesNo dialog for save
* fixed AB line setting, must drive a ways before setting B point.
* Set Auto Manual buttons on to off if other turned on to be easier
* individual section buttons
* added zoom by touching left or right side of screen
* removed most divides with multiply, constants for pi/2 and 2 PI etc
* Tool now has Red for Off, Yellow for ON, and Green for Auto, matching the buttons
* Sections are in control of on off request now, not buttons. Buttons simply change button states of sections


v1.3.0.1 22 Nov 2016

* Most settings with graphics and easier to set
* GPS Fix is at antenna, Pivot, Hitch, tool all calculated now
* Section on off now by request with a section control as event handler
* Communications has own window
* Variables Window
* Vehicle track for Antenna, Pivot point, Tool
* individual button for Off Auto On control of sections. Manual All and Auto All buttons
* changed to have each section remeber its own off auto status and the buttons merely changing those
	not having buttons remember their own status


v1.2 October 2016

* Fixed the RMC and GGA parsing routine, rather then reading an NMEA line and then updating, read all existing lines and process all at once. 
	- much faster accumulation of data
* Changed OpenGL draw routine from being triggered when RMC rec'd to 5 frames per second and triggering functions from there.
	- three seperate threads - GPS Serial IO and decoding NMEA stream, sectionRelay serial IO, Draw routine. 
* Ability to save and retrieve fields
* Changed the Section tab to remove clutter with less sections
* added section on and off request in section control. Allows the section to delay turning off and when turned on to remain on for 2 secs minimum.
* Fixed fonts consistency
* Added bottom status bar - looks way better in Linux
* Added Arduino serial port to control sectionRelays
* Output the section on off status to Arduino for full external control of sections
* Added port selection to choose port for sectionRelays.
* added hitched or rigid in vehicle
* added antenna height in vehicle
* added port status in status bar
* added distance reset in status bar
* fixed section drawing so it uses section position rather then fix position to end section drawing
* added a guidance page to set overlap
* fixed bug in section control loosing accuracy from converting double to int too soon. (missing a pixel or two)


September 2016
Added section control, Properties page, still pretty rough


June 2016
v1.0.0.1 Basic application with all its warts and bugs
